# MewMewSearch
This is a program meant to search for potentially useful information when the user requests for a web search from the searched website. The goal is to find text that relates to the user's request from a website. The librrary used is spacy and the transformer library from hugging face. It is meant to be integrated to fullfill the websearch capabiltiies of an ai chatbot.

As of now, it heavily relies on the roberta model from hugging face that is kind of inaccurate. Perhaps in the future I will update this notebook by training a custom model under the squad dataset, but it works decent enough for what I am doing!
